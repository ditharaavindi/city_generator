## 📋 Project Overview

City Designer is a sophisticated OpenGL-based application that generates procedural cities with both 2D and 3D visualization modes. Built with C++11, it demonstrates advanced computer graphics techniques, software engineering best practices, and modular code organization.

City Designer is an interactive application that allows users to design and visualize custom futuristic cities by combining procedural 2D artwork with immersive 3D environments. The project demonstrates mastery of fundamental graphics algorithms including Bresenham's Line Algorithm, Midpoint Circle Algorithm, and 3D texture mapping.
